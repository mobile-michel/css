title: About CSS reset
description: A CSS reset is a set of CSS rules that aim to override the default styles provided by web browsers. The purpose of a CSS reset is to establish a consistent design across different browsers by removing any default styling that may vary between them. This creates a certain amount of headaches for developers, who canâ€™t find out how to make their websites look the same in every browser.
